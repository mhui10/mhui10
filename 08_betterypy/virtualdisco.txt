$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero

What it does:
When we ran this command in terminal, there appeared a new directory called myherozero. Upon entering this directory and listing it’s items, we saw 4 more items:
Madelyn’s contained
Bin (directory)
Contained a lot of activate files with extensions (.ps1,.csh,.fish)
pip(S)
Python versions
Easy_install(s)
Include (directory)
empty
Lib (directory)
Contained python3.8
Pyvenv.cfg(not a directory)
When I nano-ed into Pyvenv.cfg, I saw three lines, of which stated my python version.

What we know from python manual: 
       -m module-name
              Searches  sys.path for the named module and runs the correspond-
              ing .py file as a script.
In this case, module-name is venv.
The ~ is the home directory, and myherozero is the name of the directory created.

Terminal, man python3
